Understanding a language's morphology helps us to:

- Recognise its words.
- Identify their [type](/chapters/word-types).
- Create our own words.

<Info type="jargon" title="Morphology">
In linguistics, morphology is the study of words and how they are constructed.
</Info>

If we compare it to cooking, a language's morphology contains the recipes to
make different types of words.

In this chapter, we'll focus on the ingredients of Eberban's morphology which
we'll call "morphology&nbsp;features".

## A self-segregating morphology

Eberban's morphology is designed to be self-segregating. That means we can
unambiguously parse each word and identify their word boundaries just by
reading/hearing the letters themselves.

This is true for all word types except quotation particles, which we'll get to
in a later chapter.

## Symbols

When we get to the Word Types chapter, we'll teach you each of their structures.
This will come in two representations: English instructions and a symbolic
representation.

Similar to a maths equation, the symbolic representation sums up the
instructions tersely so that they're easier to discuss and remember.

Now let's go over the symbols that are completely foreign.

### Vhowels

<Info type="jargon" title="Vhowels">
When talking about the structure of each word type, "h" is always mentioned
whenever vowels are. And "h" is only ever seen between vowels.

Let's coin the term "vhowel" (pronounced "vee-howl") to be a member of the set
\{h,i,e,a,o,u\}. Note that if there is only one vhowel, then it cannot be "h",
as "h" must be between vowels.
</Info>

Symbol: `V̌`

### Sonorants

Sonorants never begin a word. They can be found in consonant pairs, consonant
triplets, between vhowels, or at the end of a word. 

Symbol: `Ç`

### Consonant pairs

<Info type="jargon" title="Consonant pairs">
Eberban has categorised consonant pairs into two types: initial and medial.
Initial pairs are almost only found at the beginning of a word, whereas medial
pairs must always be between vhowels.
</Info>

![A table that distinguishes consonant pairs. Initial pairs are filled in blue,
medial in pink, and invalid in grey. The invalid pairs are labeled with reasons
why they have been deemed so.](/consonant-pairs.png "All consonant pairs.")

Legend:

- <span class="text-[#b4c7dc] font-bold dark:drop-shadow-md">Initial pairs</span>
- <span class="text-[#bf819e] font-bold dark:drop-shadow-md">Medial pairs</span>
- <span class="text-[#333333] font-bold dark:drop-shadow-md dark:[text-shadow:1px_1px_gray]">Invalid pairs</span>

Initial pair symbol: <code>(CC)<sub>i</sub></code><br />
Medial pair symbol: <code>(CC)<sub>m</sub></code>

### Consonant triplets

<Info type="jargon" title="Consonant triplets">
A consonant triplet is three consonants ABC such that:

- A is NOT a sonorant
- AB is a medial pair
- BC is an initial pair
</Info>

Just like the medial pairs and the letter h, they must be between vowels.

<Info type="examples">
- kfr
- dvn
- gbj
</Info>

Symbol: <code>(ꞒC<sub>m</sub>C<sub>i</sub>)</code>

### Glues

<Info type="jargon" title="Glues">
A glue is three consonants ABC such that:

- A is a sonorant
- BC is an initial pair
</Info>

Called "glue" because the order of sonorant then initial pair doesn't normally
stick together.

<Info type="examples">
- njb
- rsk
- lfr
</Info>

Symbol: <code>(ÇCC<sub>i</sub>)</code>

### Table of symbols

Here are all of the symbols. You'll see them again in the Word Types chapter as
a dropdown.
