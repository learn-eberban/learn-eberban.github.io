This chapter details the types of Eberban words. Here's all of them at a glance:

<WordTypes client:load />

This chapter also teaches you how to _form_ them. 

Eberban's morphology is designed to be self-segregating. That means we can
identify the word boundaries just by the letters themselves without ambiguity.
It's why we have the word-boundary-marker; for the couple of cases that would
otherwise be ambiguous.

<Info type="jargon" title="Morphology">
In linguistics, morphology is the study of words and how they are constructed.
</Info>

When talking about the structure of each word type, "h" is always mentioned
whenever vowels are. And "h" is only ever seen between vowels. 

Let's coin the term "vhowel" (pronounced "vee-howl") to be the set of vowels and
the letter h. Note that if there is only one vhowel, then it cannot be h, as h
must be between vowels.

**Note 1:** the use of "vhowel" is here to make explanations easier, it'll only
be seen in this chapter.

**Note 2:** this chapter shows examples of Eberban words and their meanings.
Don't worry about what `E:` and `A:` means etc., this will be explained later.
Right now, we recommend focusing only on their morphology.

## Particles

Particles facilitate forming an Eberban sentence. With them, you can express
your thoughts with precision and use your own speaking style.

Particles are grouped into families that share the same pattern. Each family is
written in all caps using the alphabetically-first particle in its family. For
instance, `MI` represents `mi`, `mie`, `mio`, `me`, `ma`, etc... as the vowel
order is "ieaou".

Particles begin with a single non-sonorant consonant and are followed only by
vhowels.

<Info type="examples">
- <DictEntry client:load inline id="unfcuerxgm" /> {/* mi */}
- <DictEntry client:load inline id="awzbv8iu8c" /> {/* pa */}
</Info>

As seen, particles function in one of two ways. Some particles, like the `MI`
family, act like predicates. Other particles, like the `PA` family, serve a
grammatical purpose.

## Content Words

Content words express the meaning of an Eberban sentence. All content words are
predicates.

The structure of content words may include two consonants in a row, but never
more. These consonant pairs are categorised below:

![A table that distinguishes consonant pairs. There are three types: initial, medial, and invalid pairs.](/consonant-pairs.png "All consonant pairs.")

Legend:

- <span class="text-[#b4c7dc] font-bold dark:drop-shadow-md">Initial pairs</span>
- <span class="text-[#bf819e] font-bold dark:drop-shadow-md">Medial pairs</span>
- <span  class="text-[#333333] font-bold dark:drop-shadow-md dark:[text-shadow:1px_1px_gray]">Invalid pairs</span>

Just like the letter h, a medial pair can only appear between two vowels.

### Roots

Roots are the building blocks of the language and express meanings that would be
too hard or long to convey otherwise. 

There are two options for a root's structure.

**Root Structure Option 1:**

1. Begin the root with a non-sonorant consonant.
1. Follow it with at least one vhowel.
1. Two options:
   1. Either follow it with a sonorant and any number of vhowels.
   1. Or follow it with a medial pair and at least one vhowel.
1. Optionally repeat step 3 as much as you'd like.
1. End.

<Info type="examples">
- <DictEntry client:load inline id="vz1h8ccnmh" /> {/* ber */}
- <DictEntry client:load inline id="pwmxutektw" /> {/* ban */}
- <DictEntry client:load inline id="la6bqysk7n" /> {/* mana */}
- <DictEntry client:load inline id="r9jofkaowc" /> {/* viru */}
</Info>

**Root Structure Option 2:**

1. Begin the root with an initial pair.
1. End it with at least one vhowel.
1. Optionally:
   1. Either end it with a sonorant, and optionally go back to step 2.
   1. Or follow it with a medial consonant pair and go back to step 2.

<Info type="examples">
- <DictEntry client:load inline id="0uujkotag5" /> {/* pcien */}
- <DictEntry client:load inline id="i24b50cv0l" /> {/* ckual */}
- <DictEntry client:load inline id="scjlbqkhj0" /> {/* pra */}
- <DictEntry client:load inline id="r7wbdwqgm0" /> {/* gli */}
</Info>

### Borrowings

Borrowings let you import foreign words or names. They are not present in the
dictionary, but can appear in compounds combined with a root word or particle.

Borrowings begin with `u` and are either surrounded by spaces or
word-boundary-markers.

**Borrowing Structure:**

1. Prefix the word:
   1. First, either a space or `'`
   1. Then `u`
   1. Append `'` if the first letter will be `u`
1. Begin it with one of the following:
   1. A single letter (yes this includes h)
   1. An initial or medial pair
   1. A consonant triplet
1. Optionally continue alternating. You may alternate between vhowels and any of
the following:
   1. A single consonant
   1. An initial or medial pair
   1. A consonant triplet
1. End it:
   1. Either with a vowel
   1. Or a vowel and a single consonant
1. Suffix it with a space or `'`.

C1C2C3 is a **consonant triplet** if:

- Either C1C2 is a medial pair and C2C3 is an initial pair.
- Or C1 is a sonorant and C2C3 is an initial pair.

<Info type="examples">
- <DictEntry client:load inline id="ql0k4zdkcv" /> {/* e ufranse stan */}
- <DictEntry client:load inline id="funyada7wl" /> {/* e uinglic ban */}
- **za u'unicef**: [E:tce p] is named UNICEF".
</Info>

Borrowings are terminated with the particle `be`, but this is only required when
talking about two separate borrowings consecutively:

Examples:

- za uhenri ufordo: [E:tce p] is named Henry Ford.
- za uhenri be ufordo: [E:tce p] is named Henry and is a "Ford". (Maybe
someone named their car?)

Test out your own borrowings using the
[visual&nbsp;parser](https://eberban.github.io/eberban/web/parser_box_glosser.html)!

### Compounds

Compounds let you combine words to make a new word. You're allowed to combine
roots, particles, and borrowings (borrowings may only appear as the first word).
You can't combine compounds.

Compounds start with "e", "a", or "o" and can be written with/without spaces due
to Eberban's self-segregating morphology.

<Info type="examples">
- "e" marks a two-word compound: (<DictEntry client:load inline id="funyada7wl" />) {/* e ber ban */}
- "a" marks a three-word compound: (<DictEntry client:load inline id="jpvb7ytjfg" />) {/* a ce po bu */}
- "o" marks a four-or-more compound. Currently, none exist.
</Info>

Because we don't know how long a four-or-more compound could be, they must be
ended with `'o` or ` o`.

### Freeform Variables

Freeform variables let you define predicates with a custom name. For example, a
freeform variable may be used to define a concept in a fictional world. Freeform
variables do not appear in the dictionary at all.

Freeform variables follow the same structure as borrowings except that their
prefix is "i".

<Info type="examples">
- po ipandoran se espuackuil va unavi: Define Pandora as the home planet of
the Na'vi.

Now `ipandoran` is [E: tca pan] is the home planet of the Na'vi" (we'll come
back to this example).
</Info>

Unlike borrowings, freeform variables don't merge. Thus, they cannot be
terminated with `be`.
