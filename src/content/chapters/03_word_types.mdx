This chapter details the types of Eberban words. Here's all of them at a glance:

<WordTypes client:load />

This chapter also teaches you how to _form_ them. 

Eberban's morphology is designed to be self-segregating. That means we can
unambiguously parse each word and identify their word boundaries just by looking
at the letters themselves. This is true for all word types except quotation
particles, which we'll get to in a later chapter.

In linguistics, morphology is the study of words and how they are constructed.

## Before we begin

### Eberban words

This chapter shows examples of Eberban words and their meanings. How to read
these meanings is not the focus of this chapter and will be explained when we
get to the [Fundamentals](../chapters/fundamentals). Right now, we recommend
focusing only on the morphology.

### Vhowels

When talking about the structure of each word type, "h" is always mentioned
whenever vowels are. And "h" is only ever seen between vowels. 

Let's coin the term "vhowel" (pronounced "vee-howl") to be the set of vowels and
the letter h. Note that if there is only one vhowel, then it cannot be h, as h
must be between vowels.

**Note:** the use of "vhowel" is here to make explanations easier, it'll only
be seen in this chapter.

### Morphology symbols v1

As we teach you how to form the Eberban word types, English may prove to be a
little wordy. To complement your understanding, we'll also provide a symbolic
representation.

|            Symbol             | Meaning                       |
|:-----------------------------:|:-----------------------------:|
|              `Ꞓ`              | Non-sonorant consonant        |
|              `V̌`              | Vhowel                        |
|              `+`              | 1 or more of the preceding    |

This table is cumulative, we'll see it again with more symbols later in this
chapter.

## Particles

Particles facilitate forming an Eberban sentence. With them, you can express
your thoughts with precision and use your own speaking style.

Particles are grouped into families that share the same pattern. Each family is
written in all caps using the alphabetically-first particle in its family. For
instance, `MI` represents `mi`, `mie`, `mio`, `me`, `ma`, etc... as the vowel
order is "ieaou".

Particles begin with a single non-sonorant consonant and are followed only by
vhowels.

<Symbolic>ꞒV̌+</Symbolic>

<Info type="examples">
- <DictEntry client:load inline id="unfcuerxgm" /> {/* mi */}
- <DictEntry client:load inline id="awzbv8iu8c" /> {/* pa */}
</Info>

As seen, particles function in one of two ways. Some particles, like the `MI`
family, are also content words: they express meaning. Other particles, like the 
`PA` family, serve a grammatical purpose.

## Content Words

Content words express the meaning of an Eberban sentence. All content words are
predicates.

Before we dive into the content words let's look at some morphology features.

### Consonant pairs

Eberban has categorised consonant pairs into two types: initial and medial.
Initial pairs are only found at the beginning of a content word, whereas medial
pairs must be between vowels.

![A table that distinguishes consonant pairs. Initial pairs are filled in blue,
medial in pink, and invalid in grey. The invalid pairs are labeled with reasons
why they have been deemed so.](/consonant-pairs.png "All consonant pairs.")

Legend:

- <span class="text-[#b4c7dc] font-bold dark:drop-shadow-md">Initial pairs</span>
- <span class="text-[#bf819e] font-bold dark:drop-shadow-md">Medial pairs</span>
- <span class="text-[#333333] font-bold dark:drop-shadow-md dark:[text-shadow:1px_1px_gray]">Invalid pairs</span>

### Consonant triplets

A consonant triplet is three consonants ABC such that:

- A is NOT a sonorant
- AB is a medial pair
- BC is an initial pair

<Info type="examples">
- kfr
- dvn
- gbj
</Info>

They are only allowed inside roots, and just like the medial pairs and the
letter h, they must be between vowels.

### Sonorants

Sonorants may either appear between vowels or at the end.

|                     `+`                    | 1 or more of the preceding    |

### Roots

Roots are the building blocks of the language and express meanings that have
been deemed indecomposable.

There are two root structures.

**Root Structure 1 - Non-sonorant:**

1. Begin the root with a non-sonorant consonant.
1. Follow it with at least one vhowel.
1. &nbsp;
   1. Three choices:
      1. Follow with a sonorant.
      1. Follow with a medial pair.
      1. Follow with a consonant triplet.
   1. Follow with at least one vhowel.
1. Optionally repeat step 3 as much as you'd like.
1. Optionally end with a sonorant.

<Symbolic>ꞒV̌+( (Ç|(CC)<sub>m</sub>|(ꞒC<sub>m</sub>C<sub>i</sub>))V̌+ )+Ç?</Symbolic>

- <DictEntry client:load inline id="r9jofkaowc" /> {/* viru */}
</Info>

**Root Structure Option 2 - Initial pair:**

1. Begin the root with an initial pair.
1. Follow it with at least one vhowel.
1. This step is optional, follow it any number of times.
   1. Three choices:
      1. Follow with a sonorant.
      1. Follow with a medial pair.
      1. Follow with a consonant triplet.
   1. Follow with at least one vhowel.
1. Optionally end with a sonorant.

- <DictEntry client:load inline id="r7wbdwqgm0" /> {/* gli */}
</Info>

### Glues

A glue is three consonants ABC such that:

- A is a sonorant
- BC is an initial pair

Called "glue" because the order of sonorant then initial pair doesn't normally
stick together.

This is the completed table.

### Borrowings

Borrowings let you import foreign words or names. They are not present in the
dictionary, but can appear in compounds combined with a root word or particle.

Borrowings begin with the letter u and are always between boundaries.

Just like with roots, there are two borrowing structures.

**Borrowing Structure 1 - Vowel:**

1. Prefix the word:
   1. With a boundary: either a space or `'`
   1. Then `u`
1. Begin with a vowel. If the vowel is the letter u, place a boundary before it.
1. Follow with any number of vhowels.
1. Six choices:
   1. The letter h.
   1. A single consonant.
   1. An initial pair.
   1. A medial pair.
   1. A consonant triplet.
   1. A glue.
1. Follow with at least one vhowel.
1. Optionally go back to step 4.
1. Optionally end with a single consonant.
1. Suffix the word with a boundary.

<Symbolic>Bu(Bu|(V-u))V̌*( (C<sub>any</sub>|h)V̌+ )+C?B</Symbolic>

**Borrowing Structure 2 - Consonant:**

1. Prefix the word:
   1. With a boundary: either a space or `'`
   1. Then `u`
1. Six choices:
   1. The letter h.
   1. A single consonant.
   1. An initial pair.
   1. A medial pair.
   1. A consonant triplet.
   1. A glue.
1. Follow with at least one vhowel.
1. Six choices:
   1. The letter h.
   1. A single consonant.
   1. An initial pair.
   1. A medial pair.
   1. A consonant triplet.
   1. A glue.
1. Optionally go back to step 3.
1. Follow with at least one vhowel.
1. Optionally end with a single consonant.
1. Suffix the word with a boundary.

<Symbolic>Bu(C<sub>any</sub>|h)(V̌+(C<sub>any</sub>|h))+V̌+C?B</Symbolic>

<Info type="examples">
- <DictEntry client:load inline id="ql0k4zdkcv" /> {/* e ufranse stan */}
- <DictEntry client:load inline id="funyada7wl" /> {/* e uinglic ban */}
- **za u'unicef**: [E:tce p] is named "UNICEF".
</Info>

Borrowings are terminated with the particle `be`, but this is only required when
talking about two separate borrowings consecutively:

<Info type="examples">
- **za uhenri ufordo**: [E:tce p] is named Henry Ford.
- **za uhenri be ufordo**: [E:tce p] is named Henry and is a "Ford". (Maybe
someone named their car?)
</Info>

Test out your own borrowings using the
[visual&nbsp;parser](https://eberban.github.io/eberban/web/parser_box_glosser.html)!

### Freeform Variables

Freeform variables let you define predicates with a custom name. One use case
for this word type would be to define a concept in a fictional world. Words of
this type do not appear in the dictionary at all.

Freeform variables follow the same structure as borrowings except that their
prefix is "i". Because of this, we'll skip the instructions and just show the
symbolic representations.

<Symbolic prefix="Vowel" spaces={8}>Bi(Bi|(V-i))V̌*( (C<sub>any</sub>|h)V̌+ )+C?B</Symbolic>

<Symbolic prefix="Consonant">Bi(C<sub>any</sub>|h)(V̌+(C<sub>any</sub>|h))+V̌+C?B</Symbolic>

<Info type="examples">
- po ipandoran se espuackuil va unavi: Define Pandora as the home planet of
the Na'vi.

Now `ipandoran` is [E: tca pan] is the home planet of the Na'vi"
</Info>

Unlike our Henry Ford borrowings example, freeform variables don't need to be
terminated with `be`.

### Compounds

Compounds let you combine words to make a new word. You're allowed to combine
roots, particles, and borrowings (borrowings may only appear as the first word).
You can't combine compounds.

Compounds can be written with/without spaces and are classified by their
starting letters.

<Info type="examples">
"e" and "ei" both mark a two-word compound:

- <DictEntry client:load inline id="funyada7wl" /> {/* e ber ban */}
- <DictEntry client:load inline id="b0pxo862df" /> {/* ei ceu bu */}

"a" and "ai" mark a three-word compound:

- <DictEntry client:load inline id="jpvb7ytjfg" />) {/* a ce po bu */}
- No "ai" compound exists.

"o" and "oi" mark a four-or-more compound. Currently, none exist.
</Info>

Because we don't know how long a four-or-more compound could be, they must be
ended with a boundary and then the letter o.
