Behold, the alphabet!

It is comprised of
<span class="text-cyan-600 dark:text-cyan-200">16 consonants</span>,
<span class="text-fuchsia-600 dark:text-fuchsia-200">5 vowels</span>,
<span class="text-orange-600 dark:text-orange-200">h</span> and <code class="text-green-600 dark:text-green-400">{wordBoundaryMarker}</code>
(the word-boundary-marker). This comes to a grand total of 23 letters.

## Pronunciation

Eberban is phonetic, that is, each letter is pronounced only one way. Here is
how:

<Info type="jargon" title="IPA">
The IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet) is a set of unique symbols designed
to denote all the sounds of human speech.

All IPA notation on this site will be surrounded with [] or ().
</Info>

As you can see, the single quote character represents the word-boundary-marker.
There is no preference as to which kind of single quote you use, any
similarly-looking ones are accepted. Also, if you're not spelling `'` out loud,
then it is pronounced as a pause, not "uhu".

Also, note the combination of the letters "tc" and "dj" match the English
pronunciation of the letters "ch" and "j" respectively.

We weren't kidding when we said that each letter is pronounced. Each vowel is
pronounced separately too, _they are not combined_. Try doing this with the word
"coin". You may have to practise slowing your pronunciation down if you're not
used to it!

### Alternative pronunciations

If the word-boundary-marker is before a word that starts with a vowel, then you
have the option of pronouncing it as a glottal stop (heard in the word "uh-oh").

You may use glides <AudioButton src="/audio/alt/glide_y.mp3">[j]</AudioButton>
and <AudioButton src="/audio/alt/glide_w.mp3">[w]</AudioButton> alongside or
instead of vowels i and u. 

An English speaker will likely struggle with pronouncing the letter r. There are
two alternative trill pronunciations:

- The Spanish r <AudioButton src="/audio/alt/r_spanish.mp3">[r]</AudioButton>
- The French r <AudioButton src="/audio/alt/r_french.mp3">[ʀ]</AudioButton>

If you're struggling with pronunciation, just remember that as long as the
uttered sound is close to the preferred or listed alternative and cannot be
confused for another letter, then you're doing just fine.

## The roles of the letters

The alphabet was ordered to be culturally neutral. The order also groups the
letters into different types.

The letter h stands in its own role. It is only seen between vowels and neither
begins nor ends words.

The next three letters (n, r, and l) are sonorants. This is an important
distinction. Sonorants only appear between two vowels or at the end of a word.

<Info type="jargon" title="Sonorants">
In phonetics, a sonorant is any sound in speech that can be continuously
produced without interruption. The sonorants in the Eberban alphabet are n, r,
l, m, and all the vowels.

An Eberban sonorant refers to any of the three consonants n, r, or l.
Henceforth, the usage of "sonorant" will refer to an Eberban sonorant.
</Info>

Then there are the consonants. Except for m, the rest of the consonants are
grouped into unvoiced and voiced pairs. This ranges from sounds made in the
front of the mouth (p, b) to sounds made at the back (k, g).

You may have even noticed the spellings of the unvoiced consonants end in i, and
the spellings of the voiced consonants end in u.

<Info type="jargon" title="Voicing Consonants">
Consonants are either voiced or unvoiced. As you may have guessed, voiced
consonants are made with the voice, and unvoiced consonants are made just with
air. 

Try putting your hand up to your throat and uttering some consonants. You will
feel the vibrations from your voice box when the consonant is voiced!
</Info>

The role of vowels is twofold:

- Their single-lettered presence or absence at the beginning of a word denotes
its word type.
- Except for "i", they are used to denote predicate places.

The word-boundary-marker is the only punctuation used in Eberban. It is only
required under a couple of circumstances, and may not be used twice in a row.

Vowels at the beginning of words and usage of the word-boundary-marker will be
explained when we learn about the [Word&nbsp;Types](/chapters/word-types).

## Informally-written Eberban

Eberban makes allowances for more expression in informal writing.

Except for foreign text quotes, Eberban text, as you have seen, is written in
lowercase. Uppercase can be used informally to convey volume,
such as when yelling.

Repeated letters in succession are considered the same as a single letter that
was repeated. Such repetition is used informally to denote the spoken length of
sounds.

This is what it looks like in English:

- heyyyyyyyyyy
- thaaaaaaaanks

And in Eberban:

- pou ga snaaaaaaaaa (Welcooooome)
- nnnnnnnnn (uhhhhhhhh)

Although any character not in the alphabet is considered a space, punctuation
from other languages can be used informally. This includes but is not
limited to `"` around quotes, and `.` at the end of sentences.
