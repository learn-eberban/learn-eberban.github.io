<Info type="jargon" title="Chaining">
Chaining is the process of how two side-by-side predicates combine to form a new
predicate.
</Info>

Thus far we've only made one-word sentences. Either "pa" and some proposition or
"pa" and some other kind of predicate using Arity Mismatch Resolution.

So how do we speak sentences packed full of predicates? Well, we start from the
right and keep chaining two predicates until we've got a one-word sentence, like
so:

TODO only use a number of predicates equal to the length of the longest sentence in this chapter!
`pa [p1 [p2 [p3 [p4 p5]]]]`

Starting from "p4" and "p5", going to "p3" and "p4 p5", and finishing with "p1
 p2 p3 p4 p5", which then gets asserted by "pa". The finer details depend on
what kind of predicates we're chaining.

## Propositions

Propositions have no places, so we chain them using "and" (logical conjunction).
We'll get to other connectives, like "or" and "not", later.
