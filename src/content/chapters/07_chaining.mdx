Once you get chaining the whole language gets easy :p

<Info type="jargon" title="Chaining">
Chaining is the process of how two side-by-side predicates combine to form a new
predicate.
</Info>

Thus far we've only made one-word sentences. Either "pa" and some proposition or
"pa" and some other kind of predicate using Arity Mismatch Resolution.

So how do we speak sentences packed full of predicates? Well, we start from the
right and keep chaining two predicates until we've got a one-word sentence, like
so:

TODO only use a number of predicates equal to the length of the longest sentence in this chapter!
`pa [p1 [p2 [p3 [p4 p5]]]]`

Starting from "p4" and "p5", going to "p3" and "p4 p5", and finishing with "p1
p2 p3 p4 p5", which then gets asserted by "pa". The finer details depend on
what kind of predicates we're chaining.

## Propositions

Propositions have no places, so we chain them using "and" (logical conjunction).
We'll get to other connectives, like "or" and "not", later.

There are no places, so chaining propositions is unordered (they'll all mean the same thing) one big proposition

## Properties

(where transitivity??)
Draft: Properties each have one place. Chaining properties = binding th eE place.

Talk about syntax = same but semantics depends on type (transitivity talked about in relations)

### Atom-typed places

set narrowing, it's unordered (talk about it any order) as long as the type and
quantity match up.

set narrowing describes the atom, and atoms aren't explicitly mentioned as AMR
uses existentaial variables, not speakers

-happy path
-default binds
-arity mismatch (0 < 1)
- arity 1 > 0

### Predicate-typed places

-happy path
-default binds (none AFAIK)
-arity mismatch (0 < 1)
- arity 1 > 0

## Higher arity predicates

relations

## Which place?

-transitivity, E or A

3-ary and above will be talked about more in place selection (as O, U and
others aren't exposed t ochaining by default)

## Brackets

## Chaining Nonsense

will always evaluate to proveably false

chaining an atom-typed place to a predicate-typed place:
-pa mian zvaor

atom-type mismatch

pa eberban pcien and pa pcien eberban (pan =/= ban -> nonsense -> false)

quantity mismatch
