<Info type="jargon" title="Chaining">
Chaining is the process of how two side-by-side predicates combine to form a new
predicate.
</Info>

Thus far we've only made one-word sentences, so how do we speak sentences packed
full of predicates?

We take the two right-most predicates, then chain the left to the right. Rinse
and repeat.

<Info type="examples">
`pa [p1 [p2 [p3 [p4 p5]]]]`

The first chained predicate is "p4 p5", which "p3" chains to, forming
"p3 p4 p5". This continues until we get the predicate "p1 p2 p3 p4 p5", which
then gets asserted by "pa".
</Info>

The actual details of this process depend on the predicates that we're
chaining.

## Propositions

Propositions have no overt places, so there's no binding. We chain two
propositions together using "and" (logical conjunction) to form a larger
compound proposition.

Since we chain with "and", the order does not matter. These example sentences
are interchangeable.

<Info type="examples">
- <DictEntry client:load id="eebgcxilaa" /> {/* cluen */}
- <DictEntry client:load id="jl7ojeesj9" /> {/* vzoun*/}
- pa cluen vzoun
  - Translation: "It's a summer's evening."
  - Literally: "It is summer and it is evening."
- pa vzoun cluen
  - Translation: "It's an evening of summer."
  - Literally: "It is evening and it is summer."
</Info>

Here's what the chained predicates look like:

Lacking overt places, propositions are limited in what meaning they can express.

## Properties

Properties have one overt place, "E". How they're bound depends on the place.

### Atom places

Atoms are not in Eberban's vocabularyâ€”because they have no intrinsic meaning.
Instead, we rely on Arity Mismatch Resolution to create them as existential
atom arguments.

These existential atom arguments are bound to atom places. With each binding, an
existential atom argument is narrowed by argument quantity and type.

<Info type="examples">
TODO, get the word meaning here
mian cat
miun sleeps
zmen white
zun boy
za usnobel
future: coriu is possessed/owned by

sleeping white boy cat named Snowbell
</Info>

TODO set narrowing diagram here

TODO atom chaining (dot to predicate)

The set of sleeping white boy cats named Snowbell is far narrower than the set
of all cats.

Similar to propositions, atom properties can be chained in any order so long as
the argument quantity and type of each place match up.

### Predicate places

When chaining two side-by-side properties with predicate places, the left's "E"
place takes the right predicate as its argument. Because of this behaviour, the
order matters.

TODO examples

- funny: it is funny that E:() is true
- absurd: it is absurd that E:() is true
- acidental: it is accidental that E:() is true

TODO diagram, figure out what name to call it

Because the right predicate is taken as the argument, there's only one arity
mismatch at the beginning!

### Default binds

Some places are often bound to the same arguments, so Eberban lists these as
defaults.

TODO examples
meul (defaults to water rains)

### Binding with propositions (arity 1 > 0)

## Higher arity predicates

mmmmmm, relations and 3-ary and more

---

### Which place?

-transitivity, E or A
Talk about syntax = same but semantics depends on type (transitivity talked about in relations)

3-ary and above will be talked about more in place selection (as O, U and
others aren't exposed t ochaining by default)

## Brackets

## Chaining Nonsense

will always evaluate to proveably false

chaining an atom-typed place to a predicate-typed place:
-pa mian zvaor

atom-type mismatch

pa eberban pcien and pa pcien eberban (pan =/= ban -> nonsense -> false)

quantity mismatch

tce tco X
