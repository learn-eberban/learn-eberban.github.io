<Info type="jargon" title="Chaining">
Chaining is the process of how two side-by-side predicates combine to form a new
predicate.
</Info>

Thus far we've only made one-word sentences. Either "pa" and some proposition or
"pa" and some predicate-turned-proposition with Arity Mismatch Resolution.

So how do we speak sentences packed full of predicates? Well, we start from the
right and keep chaining two predicates until we've got a one-word sentence, like
so:

TODO only use a number of predicates equal to the length of the longest sentence in this chapter!
`pa [p1 [p2 [p3 [p4 p5]]]]`

Starting from "p4" and "p5", going to "p3" and "p4 p5", and finishing with "p1
p2 p3 p4 p5", which then gets asserted by "pa". The finer details depend on
what kind of predicates we're chaining.

## Propositions

Propositions have no overt places, so there's no binding. We chain two propositions
together using "and" (logical conjunction).

Two propositions chained together become a larger compound proposition. The
order of this kind of chaining does not matter. E.g., the following sentences
are equivalent:

<Info type="examples">
- <DictEntry client:load id="eebgcxilaa" /> {/* cluen */}
- <DictEntry client:load id="jl7ojeesj9" /> {/* vzoun*/}
- pa cluen vzoun
  - "It's a summer evening."
  - LiterallY: "it is summer and it is evening."
- pa vzoun cluen
  - "It's an evening summer."
  - Literally: "It is evening and it is summer."

TODO: work on the stling. Ensure it aligns with Word Types.
</Info>

TOD INSERT REACT FLOW CHAINING DIAGRAM. Just connecting cluen vzoun together followed
below by vzoun cluen together.

Lacking overt places, propositions are limited in what meaning they can express.

## Properties

Properties have one overt place, "E". How they're bound depends on the place.

### Atom places

Atoms are not in Eberban's vocabularyâ€”because they have no intrinsic meaning.
Instead, we rely on Arity Mismatch Resolution to create them as existential
atom arguments.

These existential atom arguments are bound to atom places. With each binding, an
existential atom argument is narrowed by argument quantity and type.

<Info type="examples">
TODO, get the word meaning here
mian cat
miun sleeps
zmen white
zun boy
za usnobel
future: coriu is possessed/owned by

sleeping white boy cat named Snowbell
</Info>

TODO set narrowing diagram here

TODO atom chaining (dot to predicate)

The set of sleeping white boy cats named Snowbell is far narrower than the set
of all cats.

Similar to propositions, atom properties can be chained in any order so long as
the argument quantity and type of each place match up.

### Predicate places

When chaining two side-by-side properties with predicate places, the left's "E"
place takes the right predicate as its argument. Because of this behaviour, the
order matters.

TODO examples

- funny: it is funny that E:() is true
- absurd: it is absurd that E:() is true
- acidental: it is accidental that E:() is true

TODO diagram, figure out what name to call it

Because the right predicate is taken as the argument, there's only one arity
mismatch at the beginning!

### Default binds

Some places are often bound to the same arguments, so Eberban lists these as
defaults.

TODO examples
meul (defaults to water rains)

### Binding with propositions (arity 1 > 0)

## Higher arity predicates

mmmmmm, relations and 3-ary and more

---

### Which place?

-transitivity, E or A
Talk about syntax = same but semantics depends on type (transitivity talked about in relations)

3-ary and above will be talked about more in place selection (as O, U and
others aren't exposed t ochaining by default)

## Brackets

## Chaining Nonsense

will always evaluate to proveably false

chaining an atom-typed place to a predicate-typed place:
-pa mian zvaor

atom-type mismatch

pa eberban pcien and pa pcien eberban (pan =/= ban -> nonsense -> false)

quantity mismatch
