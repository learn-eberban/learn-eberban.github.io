This chapter details the types of Eberban words. Here's all of them at a glance:

<WordTypes client:load />

This chapter uses Eberban words and their meanings as examples. The notation
will be explained when we teach [Eberban Predicates](/chapters/eberban-predicates).

## Particles

<Info type="jargon" title="Particles">
Particles are words that facilitate forming an Eberban sentence. With them, you
can express your thoughts with precision and use your own speaking style.
</Info>

Particles are grouped into families that share the same pattern. Each family is
written in all caps using the alphabetically-first particle in its family. For
instance, `MI` represents `mi`, `mie`, `mio`, `me`, `ma`, etc... as the vowel
order is "ieaou".

Particles are structured by a single non-sonorant consonant followed only by
vhowels.

<Symbolic>ÍûíVÃå+</Symbolic>

<Info type="examples">
- <DictEntry client:load id="unfcuerxgm" /> {/* mi */}
- <DictEntry client:load id="awzbv8iu8c" /> {/* pa */}
</Info>

As seen, particles function in one of two ways. Some particles, like the `MI`
family, are also content words: they express meaning. Other particles, like the 
`PA` family, serve a grammatical purpose.

## Content Words

<Info type="jargon" title="Content Words">
Content words express the meaning of an Eberban sentence. All content words are
predicates.
</Info>

### Roots

<Info type="jargon" title="Roots">
Roots are content words that serve as the building blocks of the language. They
express meanings that have been deemed indecomposable.
</Info>

**Root Structure 1 - Non-sonorant:**

1. Begin the root with a non-sonorant consonant.
1. Follow it with at least one vhowel.
1. &nbsp;
   1. Three choices:
      1. Follow with a sonorant.
      1. Follow with a medial pair.
      1. Follow with a consonant triplet.
   1. Follow with at least one vhowel.
1. Optionally repeat step 3 as much as you'd like.
1. Optionally end with a sonorant.

- <DictEntry client:load id="vz1h8ccnmh" /> {/* ber */}
- <DictEntry client:load id="pwmxutektw" /> {/* ban */}
- <DictEntry client:load id="la6bqysk7n" /> {/* mana */}
- <DictEntry client:load id="r9jofkaowc" /> {/* viru */}
</Info>

**Root Structure 2 - Initial pair:**

1. Begin the root with an initial pair.
1. Follow it with at least one vhowel.
1. This step is optional, follow it any number of times.
   1. Three choices:
      1. Follow with a sonorant.
      1. Follow with a medial pair.
      1. Follow with a consonant triplet.
   1. Follow with at least one vhowel.
1. Optionally end with a sonorant.

- <DictEntry client:load id="0uujkotag5" /> {/* pcien */}
- <DictEntry client:load id="i24b50cv0l" /> {/* ckual */}
- <DictEntry client:load id="scjlbqkhj0" /> {/* pra */}
- <DictEntry client:load id="r7wbdwqgm0" /> {/* gli */}
</Info>

### Borrowings

<Info type="jargon" title="Borrowings">
Borrowings are content words that let you import foreign words or names. They
are not present in the dictionary but can appear in compounds combined with a
root or particle.
</Info>

The structures of a borrowing are much looser than those of a root, even
allowing you to use an initial pair in the middle of a word.

**Borrowing Structure 1 - Vowel:**

1. Prefix the word:
   1. With a boundary: either a space or `'`
   1. Then `u`
1. Begin with a vowel. If the vowel is the letter u, place a boundary before it.
1. Follow with any number of vhowels.
1. Six choices:
   1. The letter h.
   1. A single consonant.
   1. An initial pair.
   1. A medial pair.
   1. A consonant triplet.
   1. A glue.
1. Follow with at least one vhowel.
1. Optionally go back to step 4.
1. Optionally end with a single consonant.
1. Suffix the word with a boundary.

<Symbolic>Bu(Bu|(V-u))VÃå*((C<sub>any</sub>|h)VÃå+)+C?B</Symbolic>

<Info type="examples">
- **uaisakrim**: üç®
- <DictEntry client:load id="funyada7wl" /> {/* e uinglic ban */}
</Info>

**Borrowing Structure 2 - Consonant:**

1. Prefix the word:
   1. With a boundary: either a space or `'`
   1. Then `u`
1. Six choices:
   1. The letter h.
   1. A single consonant.
   1. An initial pair.
   1. A medial pair.
   1. A consonant triplet.
   1. A glue.
1. Follow with at least one vhowel.
1. Six choices:
   1. The letter h.
   1. A single consonant.
   1. An initial pair.
   1. A medial pair.
   1. A consonant triplet.
   1. A glue.
1. Optionally go back to step 3.
1. Follow with at least one vhowel.
1. Optionally end with a single consonant.
1. Suffix the word with a boundary.

<Symbolic>Bu(C<sub>any</sub>|h)(VÃå+(C<sub>any</sub>|h))+VÃå+C?B</Symbolic>

<Info type="examples">
- **upidza**: üçï
- <DictEntry client:load id="ql0k4zdkcv" /> {/* e ufranse stan */}
</Info>

**Multiple borrowings**

Borrowings are terminated with the particle `be`, but this is only required when
talking about two separate borrowings consecutively:

<Info type="examples">
- **za uhenri ufordo**: [E:tce p] is named Henry Ford.
- **za uhenri be ufordo**: [E:tce p] is named Henry and is a "Ford". (Maybe
someone named their car?)
</Info>

Test out your own borrowings using the
[visual&nbsp;parser](https://eberban.github.io/eberban/web/parser_box_glosser.html)!

### Freeform Variables

<Info type="jargon" title="Freeform Variables">
Freeform variables let you define predicates with a custom name. One use
case for this word type would be to define a concept in a fictional world. Words
of this type do not appear in the dictionary at all.
</Info>

Freeform variables follow the same structure as borrowings except that
their prefix is "i". Because of this, we'll skip the instructions and just show
the symbolic representations.

<Symbolic prefix="Vowel" spaces={6} hasTable={false}>Bi(Bi|(V-i))VÃå*((C<sub>any</sub>|h)VÃå+)+C?B</Symbolic>

<Symbolic prefix="Consonant" spaces={3}>Bi(C<sub>any</sub>|h)(VÃå+(C<sub>any</sub>|h))+VÃå+C?B</Symbolic>

<Info type="examples">
- po ipandoran se espuackuil va unavi: Define Pandora as the home planet of
the Na'vi.

Now `ipandoran` is [E: tca pan] is the home planet of the Na'vi"
</Info>

Unlike our Henry Ford borrowings example, freeform&nbsp;variables don't need to
be terminated with `be`.

### Compounds

<Info type="jargon" title="Compounds">
Compounds let you combine words to make a new word. You're allowed to combine
roots, particles, and borrowings (borrowings may only appear as the first word).
You can't combine compounds.
</Info>

Compounds can be written with/without spaces and are classified by their
starting letters.

<Info type="examples">
"e" and "ei" both mark a two-word compound:

- <DictEntry client:load id="funyada7wl" /> {/* e ber ban */}
- <DictEntry client:load id="b0pxo862df" /> {/* ei ceu bu */}

"a" and "ai" mark a three-word compound:

- <DictEntry client:load id="jpvb7ytjfg" />) {/* a ce po bu */}
- No "ai" compound exists.

"o" and "oi" mark a four-or-more compound. Currently, none exist.
</Info>

Because we don't know how long a four-or-more compound could be, they must be
ended with a boundary and then the letter o.
