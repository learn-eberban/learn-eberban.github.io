Beginning with this chapter, we dive into how Eberban actually works.

Eberban has two overarching [word types](/chapters/word-types): particles and
content words. Some particles are content words and _all_ content words are
predicates.

Eberban predicates differ from Logic predicates. Henceforth, the usage of
"predicate" will refer to an Eberban predicate.

## Places 

<Info type="jargon" title="Places (AKA slots)">
Places bind arguments to a predicate. We use them to express meaning with more
detail.

Places can bind any number of arguments to a predicate any number of times.
</Info>

Predicates have places.

The first of these places is called **the context**. It conveys some information
automatically, like tense (walked/walks/will walk). By design, the context is
always present, yet hidden and not directly accessible. This lets us focus on
the meaning we want to express.

The others are called **overt places** and are represented by the vowels
\{E,A,O,U\}.

All predicates have the context place and at least one overt place. Let's take
a look at one:

<Info type="examples">
<DictEntry client:load id="vgeqteao1c" /> {/* mian */}
</Info>

The property "mian" has one overt place `E`.

<Info type="reminder" title="Property">
A unary predicate is called a property. We recommend reviewing the
[logic chapter](/chapters/a-little-logic) if you still find this sort of jargon
confusing.
</Info>

## Arguments

Places have an argument quantity and an argument type. This informs us what kind
of arguments a place may bind to its predicate.

The `E` place of "mian" binds any number of arguments of quantity `tce*` and
type `pan`.

### Quantity

Most arguments that you'll see will have their quantities expressed as sets.
Sets can either be collective or distributive.

<Info type="jargon" title="Collective Sets vs. Distributive Sets">
Set A is a subset of set B if the members of A are also members of B.

A collective set denotes an exact quantity of the argument type. This is
expressed by a root starting with `tc-`.

A distributive set denotes a plural quantity that also works for subsets of the
argument type. This is expressed with one of the `tc-` roots followed by `*`.
</Info>

The argument quantity of the `E` place of "mian" is `tce*`. `tce` denotes a
non-empty set, and `*` tells us that we can use any subset of this non-empty
set.

The lack of a `tc-` root denotes a singular quantity.

### Type

Arguments are either typed as atom or predicate.

**Atoms**

<Info type="jargon" title="Atoms">
Atoms are non-predicates; they have no intrinsic meaning. An atom acquires
meaning when a place binds it to a predicate. When bound, they're used to
represent anything from an idea to a cat. In this state, atoms can be considered
nouns.
</Info>

The argument at the `E` place of "mian" has the `pan` type. Which, if we look it
up:

<div class="my-4"><DictEntry client:load id="whi7bmezoy" /></div> {/* pan */}

Will tell us that the type is a physical entity. So "mian" binds a set of one or
more physical entities to its `E` place.

**Predicates**

The predicate type is denoted with brackets. The number of letters inside the
brackets tells us the arity.

<Info type="examples">
<DictEntry client:load id="r7wbdwqgm0" /> {/* gli */}
</Info>

"gli" binds a set of one or more physical entities to its `E` place, and a
proposition to its `A` place.

## In Sentences

In Eberban, sentences are assertions. Asserting here means stating something
that you believe to be true. This does not necessarily mean that it _is_ true,
because each assertion evaluates to trivalent truth. 

<Info type="jargon" title="Trivalent truth">
We define trivalent truth to be the set \{(proveably) true,
(proveably) false, unknown/unproven\}.
</Info>

Similar to a full stop in English, an Eberban sentence is marked by `pa` at the
beginning.

<Info type="examples">
- <DictEntry client:load id="vgeqteao1c" /> {/* mian */}
- pa mian: "In the context, there exists some physical thing(s) _e_ which is a
cat."
- <DictEntry client:load id="r7wbdwqgm0" /> {/* gli */}
- pa gli: "In the context, there exists some physical thing(s) _e_ and
proposition _A_, such that _e_ is happy that _A_ is true."

In future examples, we'll omit the context unless it is the focus.
</Info>

Notice how the places of "mian" and "gli" are non-binding. Yet we have two full
sentences anyway. What's the deal with that?

<Info type="jargon" title="Non-binding">
A place that isn't binding any arguments to its predicate is called
"non-binding".
</Info>

### Existential Arguments

<Info type="jargon" title="Existential arguments">
Eberban creates an argument to be bound to each non-binding place in a sentence.
We call these created arguments "existential arguments" as Eberban has brought
them into existence.
</Info>

Let's have a look at the existential arguments in the above example. Both `E`
places of "mian" and "gli" bind to existential arguments of quantity `tce*` and
type `pan`. The `A` place of "gli" is bound to some proposition. All of these
arguments are very vague.

To provide better detail, we must supply the arguments ourselves. We'll go over
this in the bindings chapters.
