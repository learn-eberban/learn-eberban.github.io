It's time to dive into how Eberban actually works. Here we'll go over the
fundamental concepts that make this language tick.

## Atoms

You may be thinking to yourself that Eberban is all predicates and grammar. That
is nearly true. Eberban also has atoms.

<Info type="jargon" title="Atoms">
Atoms are entities, things that exist in the world, anything from an idea to a
cat. English speakers can consider them to be nouns. In Eberban, they are simply
non-predicates, and there is no direct way to refer to them.
</Info>

You won't see atoms mentioned directly, by the way. Eberban's architect decided
that explicitly providing variables for predicates is verbose. Instead, we use
predicates to talk about things.

## Eberban Predicates

Eberban predicates differ from Logic predicates. For the rest of this book, the
use of "predicate" will only refer to an Eberban predicate.

We express meaning with content words. All content words are predicates and all
predicates evaluate to trivalent truth.

<Info type="jargon" title="Trivalent logic & truth">
In Eberban, we define trivalent truth to be the set \{(proveably) true,
(proveably) false, unknown/unproven\}.
</Info>

Predicates have up to five places.

<Info type="jargon" title="Places">
Also known as slots, places are how we provide more details about what we're
saying.

We provide detail by binding places. Places can be bound any number of times,
and are typed to either receive atoms or predicates.
</Info>

The first of these places is called **the context**. The context place is always
present; it conveys some information automatically, like tense
(walked/walks/will walk). By design, this place is hidden and not directly
accessible. This lets us focus more on the meaning we want to express.

The others are called **overt places** and are represented by the vowels "e",
"a", "o", "u". These are the places that speakers interact with, and every
predicate has at least one explicit place. 

The number of explicit places is known as the predicate's arity. Similar to
Logic predicates, we label predicates of different arity:

- A 0-ary predicate is a proposition
- A unary predicate is a property
- A binary predicate is a relation

## Sentences

In Eberban, sentences are assertions. Asserting here means stating something
that you believe to be true. Not all assertions are true; they can be
false or unknown. Later on, we'll learn how to disagree or challenge assertions.
In the meantime, let's see how predicates compare to sentences:

<Info type="examples">
- mian: "_ is a cat"
- pa mian: "In the context, there exists e which is a cat."
- gli: "_ is happy that _ is true."
- pa gli: "In the context, there exists physical thing e and proposition A, such
that e is happy that A is true."

In future examples, we'll omit the context argument unless it is the focus.
</Info>

All predicate places (whether atoms or predicates) are
existentially quantified. Simply put, Eberban states that whatever we are
talking about exists.

The example predicates in the sentences have unbound places. As such, when the
places are brought into existence they are very vague.
