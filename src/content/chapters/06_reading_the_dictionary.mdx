Alright! Now's a good time to pause and realise we know enough about Eberban and
it's jargon to learn how to read the
[dictionary](https://eberban.github.io/eberban/web/dictionary.html).

The dictionary details Eberban's vocabulary and is expected to change as Eberban
grows. As we believe the dictionary to be essential to your learning journey,
we've synchronised the dictionary entries in this course with the actual
dictionary itself.

You've already seen some of these dictionary entries in previous chapters. These
entries are in inline form, and it's how Learn Eberban will mainly display them.
They look like this:

- <DictEntry client:load id="la6bqysk7n" />

In the dictionary, you'll see them in block form:

<DictEntry client:load block id="t98puegdx0" />

- <Heading name={"mua"} />: entry name
- <Gloss>{"context-apply"}</Gloss>: entry gloss, a terse explanation
- <FamilyButton>{"MI"}</FamilyButton>: entry family, the type of word. Mua is a
particle belonging to `MI`.
- <TransitivityButton isTransitive />: entry transitivity.
- <TagButton tag={"core"} />: one of the entry tags. Mua is a core part of the
grammar, so it has the green core tag.
- <Id>t98puegdx0</Id>: entry ID, guaranteed to not change (but the entry itself may disappear)
- <Meaning>True if context [E:ma] makes [A:()] true.</Meaning>: entry meaning.
The meaning explains the word's places in English.
- **Notes:** additional notes.
- **Definition:** the entry formally defined. Core words are defined in logic
notation, other words are defined in Eberban.

This course strictly differentiates between meaning and definition. All words
have meanings, but only some have definitions.
