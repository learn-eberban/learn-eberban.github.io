Logic is the study of correct reasoning. Among other things, it enables us to
prove, deduce, and solve puzzles.

This chapter is about Logic because Eberban's jargon is based on Logic jargon.

Naturally, this chapter is really jargon-heavy, so it's alright if it takes a
while to understand it all. The jargon blocks below are the only bits relevant
to Eberban; the rest is just extra for experts ðŸ™‚

## Propositional Logic

<Info type="jargon" title="Propositions">
In logic, a proposition is a statement that is true or false.
</Info>

Propositions appear in everyday speech all the time.

**Everyday propositions v1:**

- It's raining.
- I walk to work.
- It's open on Sundays too.
- She's been to Uluru.
- This is the top floor.

These propositions are atomic because they cannot be broken down any further. We
can make propositions more complex with connectives.

**Everyday propositions v2:**

| Connective                   | Name                 | Example                                                                                        | Translation                                                         |
|:----------------------------:|:--------------------:|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------:|
| <Latex formula="\land" />    | Conjunction          | <Latex formula="\text{It's raining.} \\ \land \\ \text{I forgot my umbrella.}" />              | It's raining **and** I forgot my umbrella.                          |
| <Latex formula="\lor" />     | Disjunction          | <Latex formula="\text{I walk to work.} \\ \lor \\ \text{I catch the train to work.}" />        | I walk **or** catch the train to work.                              |
| <Latex formula="\lnot" />    | Negation             | <Latex formula="\lnot(\text{It's open on Sundays too.})" />                                    | It's **not** open on Sundays either.                                |
| <Latex formula="\implies" /> | Material Implication | <Latex formula="\text{She's been to Uluru.} \\ \implies \\ \text{She's been to Australia.}" /> | **If** she's been to Uluru, **then** she's been to Australia.       |
| <Latex formula="\iff" />     | Biconditional        | <Latex formula="\text{This is the top floor.} \\ \iff \\ \text{There's no floor above it.}" /> | This is the top floor **if and only if** there's no floor above it. |

Now that we know of these connections, we can reason. Reasoning also happens all
the time in everyday speech. Take a look:

<Info type="examples">
"Has she been to Australia?"<br/>
"Yeah, she's been to Uluru."

_Finally, no more stairs! Looks like I've made it to the top floor._
</Info>

You can connect as many propositions as you'd like and still have a proposition.
For example:

<Latex 
    block 
    formula="(\\ \quad \text{The sky is clear.} \\ \quad âˆ§ \\ \quad ( \\ \qquad (\text{It's night.} âˆ§ Â¬(\text{It's too cold.})) \\ \qquad âˆ¨ \\ \qquad \text{It's the golden hour.} \\ \quad ) \\ ) \\ â†’ \\ \text{The old man goes for a walk.}"
/>

This is so wordy that we've spread this across several lines! Let's instead
denote each constituent proposition as a variable and see what it looks like.

<Info type="jargon" title="Variables">
A variable is anything that can vary in value. You can use variables to
represent absolutely anything.

By convention, uppercase variables denote propositions and predicates while
lowercase variables denote entities (things that exist).
</Info>

Given the constituent propositions (choice of letter is arbitrary):

- <Latex formula="S\text{: The sky is clear.}" />
- <Latex formula="N\text{: It's night.}" />
- <Latex formula="C\text{: It's too cold.}" />
- <Latex formula="G\text{: It's the } \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golden_hour_(photography)}{\text{golden\,hour}}\text{.}" />
- <Latex formula="W\text{: The old man goes for a walk.}" />

We state the following:

<Latex block formula="(S \land ((N \land \lnot C) \lor G)) \to W" />

Now we can focus on the connectives and start looking at what we can conclude
from this!

## Predicate Logic

If you play around with propositions, you may start to notice their limitations.
For example, it's tedious to denote that the travellers Alice, Bob, and Carol
have all been to Uluru:

- <Latex formula="A\text{: Alice has been to Uluru.}" />
- <Latex formula="B\text{: Bob has been to Uluru.}" />
- <Latex formula="C\text{: Carol has been to Uluru.}" />

<Latex block formula="A \land B \land C" />

This is because propositions aren't related unless they're logically connected,
so we have to write them all out and join them.

Thankfully we can better express this with a predicate. Let's define one for
travellers who have been to Uluru.

<Info type="jargon" title="Predicates">
A predicate is a proposition with associated variables (called arguments).
Predicates are neither true nor false until all of their variables are
substituted for values.
</Info>

<Latex block formula="\text{HAS\_BEEN\_TO\_ULURU}(t): t \text{ has been to Uluru.}" />

<Latex formula="t" /> is lowercase as it is an entity. So are
<Latex formula="alice" />, <Latex formula="bob" />, and
<Latex formula="carol." /> Shortening this predicate to
<Latex formula="U(t)" />, we substitute <Latex formula="t" /> for our
travellers:

<Latex block formula="U(alice) \land U(bob) \land U(carol)" />

If we want to talk about more than one entity without using a connective, then
we have to quantify. Here's how you talk about all the travellers:

<Latex block formula="\forall t \ U(t)">
    <p slot="header">Domain of discourse: \{Alice, Bob, Carol\}</p>
    <span class="block mt-4" slot="footer">
        <span>For all t, where t is all of Alice, Bob, Carol; t has been to Uluru.</span>
        <br />
        <span>Simply put: all of Alice, Bob, Carol, have been to Uluru.</span>
    </span>
</Latex>

The domain of discourse is the set of all possible values that
<Latex formula="t" /> can range over. So, whenever we quantify, we need the
domain of discourse.

<Info type="jargon" title="Sets">
A set is an unordered collection of distinct things. These things can be
entities, predicates, or anything else.

Sets are denoted with curly braces \{\}.
</Info>

Instead of using âˆ€ (the universal quantifier) to denote all travellers, we can
use âˆƒ (the existential quantifier) to speak about just one.

<Latex block formula="\exists t \ U(t)">
    <p slot="header">Domain of discourse: \{Alice, Bob, Carol\}</p>
    <span class="block mt-4" slot="footer">
        <span>For some t, where t is all of Alice, Bob, Carol; t has been to Uluru.</span>
        <br />
        <span>Simply put: at least one of Alice, Bob, Carol has been to Uluru.</span>
    </span>
</Latex>

Now that we've covered quantification and variables, let's derive predicates
from our everyday propositions v2.

**Everyday propositions v3:**

<Latex block formula="\exists p \ \text{RAINING} \land \text{FORGOT\_THEIR\_UMBRELLA}(p)">
    <p slot="header">Domain of discourse: All people</p>
</Latex>

<Latex block formula="\exists p \ \text{WALKS\_TO\_WORK}(p) \lor \text{TRAINS\_TO\_WORK}(p)">
    <p slot="header">Domain of discourse: All people</p>
</Latex>

<Latex block formula="\exists d \ \lnot \text{IS\_SUNDAY}(d), \ \exists s \ \text{IS\_OPEN}(s) \land \lnot(\text{IS\_TODAY}(d) \lor \text{IS\_TODAY}(sunday))">
    <p slot="header">Domains of discourse: d: Days, s: Stores</p>
</Latex>

<Latex block formula="\exists t \ U(t) \implies \text{HAS\_BEEN\_TO\_AUSTRALIA}(t)">
    <p slot="header">Domain of discourse: All travellers</p>
</Latex>

<Latex block formula="\exists f,t \ \text{IS\_TOP\_FLOOR}(t) \iff \lnot \text{IS\_ABOVE}(f,t)">
    <p slot="header">Domain of discourse: Floors</p>
</Latex>

Look how expressive predicates are!

Notice how a predicate can have any number of arguments. This number is called
arity.

<Info type="jargon" title="Arity">
Arity refers to the number of arguments a predicate has.

A 0-ary predicate is a proposition. Propositions have no variables, e.g. <Latex formula="\text{RAINING}" />.

A unary predicate takes one argument and is also called a property. Properties
describe entities, like <Latex formula="\text{IS\_TALL}(p)" /> or
<Latex formula="\text{IS\_TOP\_FLOOR}(t)" />.
 
A binary predicate takes two arguments and is also called a relation. We relate
two entities to each other like
<Latex formula="\text{IS\_MOTHER\_OF}(x,y)" /> or
<Latex formula="\text{IS\_ABOVE}(f,t)" />.

A ternary predicate takes three arguments, and an n-ary, n-arguments.
</Info>

## Higher-order Logic

If predicates of Predicate Logic are tools to talk about the world more
specifically, then these tools are limited. So far, we've only been using
entities as variables.

With Higher-order Logic, we can use predicates as variables. Through this, we
can give ourselves more tools.

By design, Eberban translates into higher-order logic and uses this idea of
making more tools to increase vocabulary and grammatical function.

Let's try to make more tools for ourselves:
Let's take one of our everyday propositions and make it higher order.

For reference, here is one of our everyday propositions v3.

<Latex block formula="\exists d \ \lnot \text{IS\_SUNDAY}(d), \ \exists s \ \text{IS\_OPEN}(s) \land \lnot(\text{IS\_TODAY}(d) \lor \text{IS\_TODAY}(sunday))">
    <p slot="header">Domains of discourse: d: Days, s: Stores</p>
</Latex>

Now here is the higher-order version, using the same domain.

<Latex block formula="\text{NEITHER\_WHEN}(P,X,Y): P \land \lnot(X \lor Y)" />
<Latex block formula="\text{NEITHER\_OPEN\_ON}(s,x,y): \text{NEITHER\_WHEN}(\text{IS\_OPEN}(s), \allowbreak \text{IS\_TODAY}(x), \text{IS\_TODAY}(y)))" />
<Latex block formula="\exists d \ \lnot \text{IS\_SUNDAY}(d), \exists s \ \allowbreak \text{NEITHER\_OPEN\_ON}(s,d,sunday)" />

The <Latex formula="\text{NEITHER\_WHEN}" /> predicate is generic and can be
used whenever you find yourself using the word neither (or words not either).
