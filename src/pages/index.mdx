    As Eberban is a work in progress, so is this course. Expect changes until
    this warning goes away.

This course teaches Eberban up to an intermediate level. If, after having
completed this course, you were teleported to Eberstan (the country of the
Eberbanic people), then you would blend in just fine. For further technical
coverage, see the
[Reference Grammar](https://eberban.github.io/eberban/books/refgram/book/index.html).

Official resources and the goals of Eberban are located
[here](https://eberban.github.io/eberban/).

## Who is this for?

This course is for everyone, not just programmers and/or logical language fans.
If you've made it this far, it's safe to say you can read English, which is the
only assumption this course makes. With this in mind, all jargon will be
introduced gently.

If this is your first time learning a new language, let alone a logical language
such as Eberban, then it may take time to digest some chapters. That's okay!
Just keep swimming üê†

## How does this work?

This course reads like a book. Each chapter will introduce a new concept
accompanied by new vocabulary, relevant jargon, and example sentences.
